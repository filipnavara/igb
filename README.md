# Intel GbE Family Community Driver for Windows 11

**Disclaimer: I am not affiliated with Intel Corporation.**

This is basic Windows 11 driver for Intel I210 controller that can be compiled for ARM64 architecture. It is not supposed to replace the Intel drivers and merely serves to fill in the void until official ARM64 drivers are available directly from Intel.
